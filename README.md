# Interactive Navigation Menu README

This project implements an interactive navigation menu for a website. The navigation menu has a fixed position and changes color when scrolled or when hovering over a menu item. The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to achieve this functionality.

## Files Included

- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the website including navigation, sections, and footer.
- `style.css`: Defines the styles for the website, including navigation, hero section, about section, and footer.
- `script.js`: Implements the JavaScript functionality for the interactive navigation menu.

## Features

- **Fixed Navigation**: The navigation menu is fixed at the top of the page, ensuring it is always visible to users as they scroll through the website.
- **Color Change on Scroll**: When the user scrolls down the page, the background color of the navigation menu changes from `#f2864b` to `#f79b69`. This effect is achieved using JavaScript.
- **Hover Effect**: When a user hovers over a menu item, a subtle underline effect is applied. This is done using CSS pseudo-elements (`::before`).
- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal viewing experience across various devices and screen sizes.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the website.

## Usage

- Navigate through the website using the links in the navigation menu.
- Observe the color change of the navigation menu when scrolling down the page.
- Hover over the menu items to see the hover effect.

## Customization

- To change the colors of the navigation menu or other elements, modify the corresponding color codes in the `style.css` file.
- Additional styling or interactivity can be added by editing the CSS and JavaScript files as needed.
